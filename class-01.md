# From the Duckett HTML book:

## Introduction (pp.2-11)

### this book is useful for :

1. how to design and build websites from scratch
2. people who wants more control over the appearance of their pages

### this book contains :

1. backgrounds
2. diagrams
3. introductions
4. referances
5. examples
6. summaries

### this book is divided into three sections:

1. html : used to create web pages
2. css : enable you to control the styling and layout of web pages and it concerns about presentation and layout of the web page
3. practical 

### there are different ways in which people access the web and clarify some terminology :

1. browsers
2. web server
3. screen readers
4. devices

### how the web works ?

*When you visit a website, the web server hosting that site could be anywhere in the world. In order
 for you to find the location of the web server, your browser will first connect to a Domain Name System (DNS) server*

## HTML Chapter 1: “Structure” (pp.12-39)

* In all kinds of documents, structure is very important in helping readers to understand
 the messages you are trying to convey and to navigate around the document

* The HTML code (in blue) is made up of characters that live inside angled brackets — these are called 
HTML elements. Elements are usually made up of two tags: an opening tag and a closing 
tag. (The closing tag has an extra forward slash in it.) Each HTML element tells the browser something 
about the information that sits between its opening and closing tags.

* Tags act like containers. They tell you something about the information that lies between 
their opening and closing tags.

* Attributes provide additional information about the contents of an element. They appear on the opening 
tag of the element and are made up of two parts: a name and a value, separated by an equals sign.

## HTML Chapter 8: “Extra Markup” (p.176-199)

* doctypes tell browser which version of html are using 
* you can add comments to your code and we can use escape charachters to include special charachters
* The <div> and <span> elements allow you to group block-level and inline elements together.
* <iframes> cut windows into your web pages through which other pages can be displayed.
* The <meta> tag allows you to supply all kinds of information about your web page.
* The id and class attributes allow you to identify particular elements.
---------------
## HTML Chapter 17: “HTML5 Layout” (pp.428-451)

* web page authors used <div> elements to group together related elements 
on the page (such as the elements that form a header, an article, footer or sidebar). Authors used 
class or id attributes to indicate the role of the <div> element in the structure of the page.
* HTML5 introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the parts of a page
* The new elements provide clearer code (compared  X with using multiple <div> elements).
-----------------------
## HTML Chapter 18: “Process & Design” (pp.452-475)

* Every website should be designed for the target audience—not just for yourself or 
the site owner. It is therefore very important to understand who your target audience is.
* targer audience are individuals and companies
* you need to consider why they are coming.
* you need to work out what information they need in order to achieve their 
goals quickly and effectively.
* site maps : what needs to appear on your site, you can start to organize the information into sections or pages.
* wireframes : A wireframe is a simple sketch of the key information that needs to go on
 each page of a site. It shows the hierarchy of the information and how much space it might require
* visual hierarchy :  the order in which your eyes perceive what they see. It is created by 
adding visual contrast between the items being displayed. Items with higher contrast are 
recognized and processed first.
* Grouping related pieces of information together can make a design easier to comprehend. 
* Site navigation not only helps people find where they want to go, but also helps them 
understand what your site is about and how it is organized. Good navigation tends to follow these principles...

### From the Duckett JS book:

## Introduction 

* JavaScript can be used in browsers to make websites more interactive, interesting, and 
user-friendly. You will also learn about jQuery because it makes writing JavaScript a lot easier. 
-----------
## JS Chapter 1: “The ABC of Programming” (pp.11-52)

* Before you learn how to read and write the JavaScript language itself, you need to become familiar with
 some key concepts in computer programming called ABC :
 
1. A : What is a script and how do I create one? 
2. B : How do computers fit in with the world around them? 
3. C : How do I write a script for a web page? 

* A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal. 
* To write a script, you need to first state your goal and then 
list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it. 
* you need to Start with the big picture of what you want to achieve, and break that down into smaller steps. 
* steps for writing a script :
1. DEFINE THE GOAL 
2. DESIGN THE SCRIPT 
3. CODE EACH STEP 
* it is necessary to do a SKETCHING OUT THE TASKS IN A FLOWCHART 
* COMPUTERS CREATE MODELS OF THE WORLD USING DATA

* you must distiguish between two things :

1. OBJECTS (THINGS) : each physical thing in website page .
* Each object can have its own: 
 * Properties 
 * Events 
 * Methods 

2. propertie : Each property has a name and a value, and each of these name/value pairs tells 
you something about each individual instance of the object. 

* EVENTS : An event is the computer's way of sticking up its hand to say, "Hey, this just happened!" 
* METHODS : Methods typically represent how people (or other things) interact with an object in the real world. 
* Computers use data to create models of things in the real world. The events, methods, and properties of an object all relate to each other: Events can trigger 
methods, and methods can retrieve or update an object's properties.
* Web browsers create similar models of the web page they are showing and of
 the browser window that the page is being shown in. 
* THE DOCUMENT OBJECT REPRESENTS AN HTML PAGE
* It is best to keep JavaScript code in its own JavaScript file. JavaScript files are text 
files (like HTML pages and CSS style sheets), but they have the . j s extension. 
* The HTML <script> element is used in HTML pages to tell the browser to load the JavaScript 
file (rather like the <link> element can be used to load a CSS file).  
* If you view the source code of the page in the browser, the JavaScript will not have changed the HTML, because the script works
 with the model of the web page that the browser has created

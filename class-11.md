## From the Duckett HTML book:
***Chapter 16: “Images” (pp.406-427)***

> Controlling the size and alignment of your images using CSS keeps rules that affect the presentation of your page in the CSS and out of the HTML markup.
* You can control the size of an image using the `width` and `height` properties in CSS, just like you can for any other box. 
* Specifying image sizes helps pages to load more smoothly because the HTML and CSS code will often load before the images
* In the CSS, you add selectors for each of the class names, then use the CSS `width` and `height` properties to control the image dimensions.
* `float` property can be used to move an element to the left or the right of its containing block, allowing text to flow around it
* `float` property used to align images. There are two ways that this is commonly achieved:
 * The `float` property is added to the class that was created to represent the size of the image 
 * New classes are created with names such as `align-left` or `align-right` to align the images to the left or right of the page
* In order to center an image, it should be turned into a `block` level element using the display property with a value of block
* Then there are two common ways in which you can horizontally center an image:
 * On the containing element, you can use the `text-align property` with a value of center
 * On the image itself, you can use the use the margin property and set the values of the left and right `margins` to auto.
* The `background-image` property allows you to place an image behind any HTML element. This could be the entire page or just part of the page
* By default, a background image will repeat to fill the entire box.
* Background images are often the last thing on the page to load 
* The `background-repeat` property can have four values:
 * repeat 
 * repeat-x 
 * repeat-y 
 * no-repeat 
* The `background-attachment` property specifies whether a background image should stay in one position or move as the user scrolls up and down the page .It has two values :fixed and scroll
* you can use the `background-position` property to specify where in the browser window the background image should be placed.
* The background property acts like a shorthand for all of the other background properties you have just seen, and also the `background-color property.`
* Using CSS, it is possible to create a link or button that changes to a second style when a user moves their mouse over it (known as a `rollover`) and a third style when they click on it
* When a single image is used for several different parts of an interface, it is known as a `sprite`.
* If you want to overlay text on a background image, the image must be low contrast in order for the text to be legible.

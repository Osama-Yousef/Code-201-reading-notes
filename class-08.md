# Read :08 Summary  
## From the Duckett HTML book:

***HTML/CSS book, Ch. 15, “Layout” (again; repeat of Class 4 reading)***

* `<div>` elements are often used as containing elements to group together sections of a page.
* Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.
* The float property moves content to the left or right of the page and can be used to create multi-column layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)
* Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts
> Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide, and indicate what the site is about within the top 600 pixels (to demonstrate its       relevance without scrolling).

* Grids help create professional and flexible designs
> CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks
* You can include multiple CSS files in one page

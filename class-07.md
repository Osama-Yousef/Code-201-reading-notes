# Read:07 Summary

* Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem. A model describes the various entities, their attributes and behaviors, as well as the constraints that govern the problem domain. An entity that stores data in properties and encapsulates behaviors in methods is commonly referred to as an object-oriented model.
* When modeling a single entity that'll have many instances, build self-contained objects with the same attributes and behaviors.
* Model its attributes with a constructor function that defines and initializes properties.
* Model its behaviors with small methods that focus on doing one job well.

## From the Duckett HTML book:
### Chapter 6: “Tables” (pp.126-145)

* The  ` <table>` element is used to add tables to a web page.
* A table is drawn out row by row. Each row is created   with the `<tr>` element.
* Inside each row there are a number of cells   represented by the `<td>` element (or `<th>` if it is a header).
* You can make cells of a table span more than one row  or column using the rowspan and colspan attributes. 
* For long tables you can split the table into a  `<thead>, <tbody>, and <tfoot>.`

## From the Duckett JS Book:


### Chapter 3: “Functions, Methods, and Objects” (pp.106-144)

* Functions allow you to group a set of related statements together that represent a single task
* Functions can take parameters (informatiorJ required to do their job) and may return a value.
* An object is a series of variables and functions that represent something from the world around you. 
* In an object, variables are known as properties of the object; functions are known as methods of the object
* Web browsers implement objects that represent both the browser window and the document loaded into the browser window. 
* Arrays and objects can be used to create complex data sets (and both can contain the other).

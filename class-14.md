## What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team

> As commerce becomes increasingly global and complex, the bulk of modern work is more and more team-based

***software engineers are encouraged to work together, in part because studies show that groups tend to innovate faster, see mistakes more quickly and find better solutions to problems.***

* Studies also show that people working in teams tend to achieve better results and report higher job satisfaction
* Project Aristotle researchers concluded that understanding and influencing group norms were the keys to improving Googleâ€™s teams
* What interested the researchers most, however, was that teams that did well on one assignment usually did well on all the others.
* However, establishing psychological safety is, by its very nature, somewhat messy and difficult to implement.
* The `transform` property comes in two different settings, two-dimensional and three-dimensional. Each of these come with their own individual properties and values.
* Elements may be distorted, or transformed, on both a two-dimensional plane or a three-dimensional plane. 
* Using the `scale` value within the `transform` property allows you to change the appeared size of an element. 
* The `translate` value works a bit like that of relative positioning, pushing and pulling an element in different directions without interrupting the normal flow of the document.
* The last `transform` value in the group, `skew`, is used to distort elements on the horizontal axis, vertical axis, or both
* With CSS3 `transitions` you have the potential to alter the appearance and behavior of an element whenever a state change occurs, such as when it is hovered over, focused on, active, or targeted.
* Animations within CSS3 allow the appearance and behavior of an element to be altered in multiple keyframes
* when more control is required, transitions need to have multiple states. In return, this is where animations pick up where transitions leave off.
